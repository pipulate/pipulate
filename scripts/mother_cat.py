"""Mother Cat trail walker, Car B: actuate Car A's validated plan.

walk.py remains the strict, stdlib-only dry-run planner. This module adds the
actuating side of the Mother Cat Kata:

  EXPORTS                  -- the walk's exports file, when one resolves, is
                              layered UNDER the environment: --exports PATH
                              wins, else <trail>.exports.sh beside the trail.
                              An exported, non-empty variable is never
                              overwritten by the file.
  PRE-FLIGHT               -- every url_env the WHOLE walk needs is checked
                              before anything opens, speaks, or writes.
                              Required and unset REFUSES; optional and unset
                              SKIPS that stop and says so.
  NARRATE                  -- Piper reads the stop guidance, best-effort.
  SETTLE + FENCE + CAPTURE -- guided_browser_capture opens the persistent,
                              visible browser and requires the human CAPTURE
                              token before writing artifacts.
  ADVANCE                  -- continue only after a successful capture receipt.

Connector execution is deliberately out of scope. This car captures context;
it does not run Jira, Botify, Gmail, or shell actuators.

    the same shape prompt_foo's secrets tripwire uses for the same reason.

    stuck shut is distinguishable from a fence correctly refusing:

    /dev/tty FIRST, the trick the CAPTURE prompt already learned: under
    `curl | bash` this process's stdin is the PIPE, so isatty(0) is the wrong
    question. mck.sh already hands the ride </dev/tty; this works either way.

    FAILS CLOSED ON NO TTY, and that is not a collision with THE FAIL-OPEN
    THRESHOLD RULE. That rule protects an ENTRY path where blocking would
    STRAND an unattended caller. This is an EXIT path: refusing does not block,
    it degrades, the artifacts are already durable, and the process still exits
    0 -- and a world with no terminal to ask on is by definition a world with
    no human waiting to paste a clipboard. Blocking on readline() is safe here
    for a stronger reason than the boot menu's isatty gate: three CAPTURE
